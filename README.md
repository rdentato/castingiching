This repo is about two very different methods for casting I Ching hexagrams.

## A Javascript app
A compact, embeddable, javascript application to cast I Ching hexagrams. 

You can see it in action embedded in a Bloggger blog: https://www.castingiching.com or plainly naked: https://rdentato.github.io/castingiching .

It can also be used locally just by double clicking on index.html.

## A custom GPT
The `customgpt` directory contains the data to create a custom GPT to cast hexagrams and get readings.
Requires a chatGPT subscription.
